I currently work on Biomedical research and data analysis capacity building in Africa on the frame of the pan-African bioinformatics network [H3ABionet](https://h3abionet.org/) connecting 27 African institutions across 16 countries. This NIH funded network aims to provide necessary infrastructure and skills to conduct cutting-edge research in order to improve African populations health outcomes. 
 I have a background in computer sciences with a PhD in Bioinformatics from the Laboratory of
Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics, Montpellier, France ([LIRMM](http://www.lirmm.fr/)). After graduating late 2013, I was very excited about H3ABionet, this rising Bioinformatics capacity building network in Africa, and wanted to be part of it. 
Within H3ABionet,  I co-led different  projects and I am a member of the consortium management committee.  I am currently co-leading the sustainability and outreach work package and  working on developing  strategic public outreach plans including governments, patients and youth. 
I enjoy teaching and designing courses and peer learning processes. I have been involved in organizing and teaching in [a number of international courses](/teaching).

Iâ€™m an  open science and open education advocate, dedicating time for designing curricula, organizing trainings and  leading discussions to  challenge the traditional scientific research workflows and  promote the open science culture in Africa. I was awarded an Open Science fellowship of the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and was also nominated as one of "[50 People Who Are Making the Internet a Better Place](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/50-people-who-are-making-the-internet-a-better-place-10a7864403d)." 

Passionate by educating and empowering young women, I founded Technovation Tunisia in 2015. This non-profit is dedicated to teaching young girls coding and entrepreneurship skills while addressing challenges in their communities as part of the global [Technovation challenge](https://technovationchallenge.org/) program.

I am currently based in Tunis and I am fortunate to call many places home. I enjoy taking on new challenges and working with people across different backgrounds, cultures and languages.
When I am away from my computer and not busy running workshops,  I enjoy spending time with family and friends, travelling, discovering new cultures  and food around the world, biking, kayaking, practicing yoga and also spending time with my camera photographing portraits and beautiful outdoors.
