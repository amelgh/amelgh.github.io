I have been involved in organizing a number of bioinformatics and data science courses as well as designing collaborative peer learning activites. I have also been invited to teach in a variety of international data science training activities. See below for a selection of courses, workshops, and hackathons.
I have also been teaching computer science modules and mentoring undergraduate students from 2005 to 2009 when I worked as an assistant professor at the Faculty of Sciences, Bizerte, Tunisia.
